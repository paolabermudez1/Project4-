  <p class="chapter-text">
   They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with
   their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable. The first question of course was,
   how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to
   find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life...
  </p>

  <p class="chapter-text">
   At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, 'Sit down, all of you, and listen
   to me! I'll soon make you dry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle...
  </p>

  <p class="chapter-text">
   'Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, 'are you all ready? This is the driest thing I know...
  </p>

  <p class="chapter-text">'Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver. 'I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning...</p>

  <p class="chapter-text">
   'Found it,' the Mouse replied rather crossly: 'of course you know what "it" means.' 'I know what "it" means well
   enough, when I find a thing,' said the Duck...
  </p>

  <p class="chapter-text">'As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone: 'it doesn't seem to dry me at all.'</p>

  <p class="chapter-text">
   'In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, 'I move that the meeting adjourn...
  </p>

  <p class="chapter-text">
   'What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone, 'was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a
   Caucus-race.' 'What is a Caucus-race?' said Alice...
  </p>

  <p class="chapter-text">
   First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle... When they had been running half an hour or so and were
   quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out 'The race is over!' and they all crowded round it...
  </p>

  <p class="chapter-text">
   At last the Dodo said, 'Everybody has won, and all must have prizes.' 'But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus
   of voices asked...
  </p>

  <p class="chapter-text">
   Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits...
  </p>

  <p class="chapter-text">'Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing...</p>

  <p class="chapter-text" style="white-space: pre-line; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;, monospace">
   Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, "Let us both go to law: I will prosecute you.—Come, I'll take no
   denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I've nothing to do." Said the mouse to the cur, "Such a trial,
   dear Sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath." "I'll be judge, I'll be jury," Said cunning old Fury:
   "I'll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death."
  </p>

  <p class="chapter-text">
   'You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely. 'What are you thinking of?' 'I beg your pardon,' said
   Alice very humbly...
  </p>

  <p class="chapter-text">
   'I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice loudly... Some of the birds hurried off at once...
  </p>

  <p class="chapter-text">'I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a melancholy tone...</p>
