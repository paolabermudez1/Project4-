        <p class="chapter-text">
            'Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how
            to speak good English); 'now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!' (for
            when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). 'Oh,
            my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure I shan't
            be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you
            can;—but I must be kind to them,' thought Alice, 'or perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go! Let me
            see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'
        </p>

        <p class="chapter-text">
            And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. 'They must go by the carrier,' she thought;
            'and how funny it'll seem, sending presents to one's own feet! And how odd the directions will look!
            <br />Alice's Right Foot, Esq. <br />Hearthrug, <br />near The Fender, <br />(with Alice's love). <br />Oh
            dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'
        </p>

        <p class="chapter-text">
            Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and
            she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.
        </p>

        <p class="chapter-text">
            Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one
            eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.
        </p>

        <p class="chapter-text">
            'You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, 'a great girl like you,' (she might well say this), 'to
            go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!' But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of
            tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.
        </p>

        <p class="chapter-text">
            After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see
            what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in
            one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he
            came, 'Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!'
        </p>

        <p class="chapter-text">
            Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she
            began, in a low, timid voice, 'If you please, sir—' The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid
            gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.
        </p>

        <p class="chapter-text">
            Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she
            went on talking: 'Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I
            wonder if I've been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost
            think I can remember feeling a little different...'
        </p>

        <p class="chapter-text">
            'I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets
            at all; and I'm sure I can't be Mabel...'
        </p>

        <p class="chapter-text">
            'How doth the little crocodile
            <br />Improve his shining tail, <br />And pour the waters of the Nile <br />On every golden scale!
            <br /><br />
            'How cheerfully he seems to grin,
            <br />How neatly spread his claws, <br />And welcome little fishes in <br />With gently smiling jaws!'
        </p>

        <p class="chapter-text">'I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice...</p>

        <p class="chapter-text">
            As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the
            Rabbit's little white kid gloves while she was talking. 'How can I have done that?' she thought. 'I must be
            growing small again.'
        </p>

        <p class="chapter-text">'That was a narrow escape!' said Alice... 'and now for the garden!'</p>

        <p class="chapter-text">
            As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt
            water... Soon she made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.
        </p>

        <p class="chapter-text">'I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about...</p>

        <p class="chapter-text">
            'O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'
        </p>

        <p class="chapter-text">'Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice...</p>

        <p class="chapter-text">'We indeed!' cried the Mouse... 'As if I would talk on such a subject!'</p>

        <p class="chapter-text">'There is such a nice little dog near our house...' Alice went on eagerly.</p>

        <p class="chapter-text">So she called softly after it, 'Mouse dear! Do come back again...'</p>

        <p class="chapter-text">
            It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded: a Duck, a Dodo, a Lory, an Eaglet, and
            several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.
